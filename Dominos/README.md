<h1>DOMINOS CASE STUDY</h1>
<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT üçï </h3>
Kanav has started his own Pizza Store by getting the Franchise from the popular Pizza brand Diminos. <br>
Dominos promises to deliver the pizza order within 31 minutes from the time the order was placed. Otherwise the pizza will be free for the customer.
In order to increase the revenue and profits Kanav is running the store 24 * 7.<br>
Recently Diminos gave a notice to Kanav that they will be measuring their stores' performance by looking at the metric - which is 95th Percentile on Order Delivery time should be less than 31 mins.<br>
Kanav is worried that he might lose the franchise if he is not able to meet the metric and wants your help in order to understand his store's performance so that he can take some actions to prevent his business. <br>
